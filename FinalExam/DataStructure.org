* Data structure
** linear list
*** list and its expansion
*** deque family
**** stack
**** queue
*** other useful linear structures
**** heap
**** set(specifically, disjoint-set structure)
** linked list
deal with the mappings, similar tree.
** tree
*** binary tree
similar to linklist, but bitwise.
** graph
*** matrix representation of graph
*** adjacency representation of graph
* Algorithms
** mappings
*** union find
*** hashing
** sort

** search
** matching
** graph algorithms

* Those ignored useful data structures and algorithms
** bloom filter
** skip list
